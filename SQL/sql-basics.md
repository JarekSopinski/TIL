## SQL basics

SQL is a relational database management system.

A database can contain several different tables, which stores a specific type ('model') of data. A tables can be releted by a foreign key (i.e. user ids).

Each table is made of rows and columns. A row represents an individual record in a table. A column represents a property on that record.

A column expects a specific type of data, i.e. an integer or a string.
